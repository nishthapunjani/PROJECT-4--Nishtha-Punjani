Task4
Develop the queries to retrieve information from the OLAP operations performed and to gain a
deeper understanding of the sales data through different dimensions, aggregations, and filters.
Project: OLAP Operations (using Redshift or PostgreSQL)
Objective: Perform OLAP operations (Drill Down, Rollup, Cube, Slice, and Dice) on the
"sales_sample" table to analyze sales data. The project will include the following tasks:
1.Database Creation
Create a database to store the sales data (Redshift or PostgreSQL).
Create a table named "sales_sample" with the specified columns:
Product_Id (Integer)
Region (varchar(50))-like East ,West etc
Date (Date)
Sales_Amount (int/numeric)
2.Data Creation
Insert 10 sample records into the "sales_sample" table, representing sales data.
3.Perform OLAP operations
a)Drill Down-Analyze sales data at a more detailed level. Write a query to perform drill down
from region to product level to understand sales performance.
b)Rollup- To summarize sales data at different levels of granularity. Write a query to perform
roll up from product to region level to view total sales by region.
c)Cube - To analyze sales data from multiple dimensions simultaneously. Write a query to
Explore sales data from different perspectives, such as product, region, and date.
d)Slice- To extract a subset of data based on specific criteria. Write a query to slice the data to
view sales for a particular region or date range.
e)Dice - To extract data based on multiple criteria. Write a query to view sales for specific
combinations of product, region, and date
